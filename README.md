# QuarkNet-Cosmic-Ray-Detector-Decoder
Converts raw data from the QuarkNet Cosmic Ray Detector and converts it into a readable format that can be imported into a spreadsheet.

This program allows the user to input the raw data from the Cosmic Ray Deterctor (CRD) in the form of a text file (*.txt) or directly from the program and processes it into a file (*.csv) which can then be imported into a spreadsheet.

NOTE:
This is meant with zTerm (?) into account so Windows compatibility is iffy.
